# Contributing

 ## Commits style
 We use [Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org) to format our
 commit messages. This helps keep the commit history clean and easy to read.
 Please follow this style when making your commits.

 ## Updating documentation
 If you make any changes that affect the documentation, please start your
 commit message with "docs:". This will trigger our documentation update
 workflow and ensure that the documentation is kept up to date.
